Communication to the server with the users position happens on a set interval, maybe 30, or 15 hz.
Same with communication back from the server.

Server should only send player positions that has actually been updated.






Server sends out:
	Food spawning orders together with their positions
	If a piece of food is eaten.
	Player positions
	If a player is killed.

Player sends out:
	Current position.



Server handles:
	Deciding when a player eats another player or some food.
	Player size calculations.

	Comparing player speeds as a form of cheat detection. (?)


Client handles:
	Taking user input and moving their character.
